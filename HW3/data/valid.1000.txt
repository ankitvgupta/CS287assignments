it largely <unk> on its <unk> <unk> N million <unk> in the first half up from N million a year ago an average <unk> of N for <unk> at the <unk> of their <unk> years <unk> to the <unk> of an N N average <unk> <unk> rate
the magazine had its best year yet in N when it <unk> its <unk> and <unk> up a N N gain in ad <unk> to N
but this year when the <unk> <unk> its <unk> <unk> so too did some <unk> interest
the reason ad executives say is that the <unk> magazine business has been <unk> and national <unk> has some <unk> that make it especially <unk> during a <unk> market
perhaps the biggest of those <unk> is its high ad prices $ N for a <unk> <unk> <unk> $ N for the <unk> a <unk> <unk> with a far <unk> <unk>
when ad dollars are <unk> the high <unk> cost is a major <unk> for <unk> who generally want to <unk> <unk> in a <unk> or not at all
even though national <unk> <unk> far more <unk> than does a magazine like <unk> the <unk> costs you an <unk> and a <unk> to <unk> any <unk> says <unk> <unk> new york <unk> manager for <unk> inc
to <unk> that problem national <unk> like other <unk> began offering <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> in only a <unk> of its <unk> for example <unk> can run only in the <unk> sent to <unk> in the largest N markets
but the magazine was <unk> than its <unk> to come up with its <unk> <unk> and until last year offered <unk> of them than did <unk>
time magazine for example has more than N <unk> <unk> going to different <unk> top management and other groups
another <unk> point for <unk> was national <unk> 's <unk> of <unk> its <unk> <unk> <unk> at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than <unk> <unk> out among its <unk> as most <unk> do
and national <unk> 's <unk> <unk> means <unk> production costs for <unk>
but ms. <unk> says the magazine is <unk> back
it now <unk> N <unk> <unk> it very recently began <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and it has been <unk> up its sales force
and it just <unk> a <unk> campaign to <unk> chief executives marketing directors and <unk> executives just that
the <unk> of the <unk> is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will <unk> about $ N <unk> in the next few weeks
the campaign <unk> by <unk> group 's <unk> <unk> agency <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that national <unk> is known for
in one ad a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> is <unk> with the <unk> the only <unk> more <unk> than <unk> does n't <unk> advertising
another ad <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> N times with the <unk> for impact far <unk> your <unk> consider our <unk> <unk>
ms. <unk> says she wants the campaign to help <unk> <unk> in N <unk> including corporate financial services consumer <unk> insurance and food
her <unk> to top N ad <unk> in N up from about N this year
whether she can meet that <unk> <unk> is still far from certain
the ad campaign is <unk> to <unk> the thought of national <unk> she says
we want it to be a <unk> kind of <unk>
<unk> plans <unk> sale

the <unk> <unk> has <unk> even <unk> since the war because <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>

the <unk> has n't been <unk> from since but we keep the staff around just in case
<unk> <unk> 's <unk> is much more <unk> to keep <unk>
we keep a lot of <unk> to him around the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and such
the <unk> <unk> on the third <unk> of the <unk> used to <unk> a lot of <unk> to him but the <unk> <unk> on the fourth <unk> made them <unk> it
you see <unk> had this thing about the <unk> and the <unk> he <unk> to make them part of the <unk> but secretary of the <unk> james <unk> <unk> him
now his <unk> wo n't <unk> up <unk> it 's done
to keep him <unk> we <unk> a new <unk> <unk> every year or so run by the <unk> or the air force and put more of the <unk> and <unk> under it
but we still <unk> him <unk> at <unk> because the <unk> has a few <unk> left and to <unk> him the <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> were given to a new air force <unk> in <unk> its space operations to another <unk> in <unk> the <unk> to a new <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to an <unk> <unk> in <unk>
which <unk> up the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>
when the <unk> <unk> president <unk> was so <unk> that the <unk> 's <unk> would <unk> him for <unk> him out to make way for the <unk> that he <unk> the <unk> <unk>
mr. <unk> said he would go to war to <unk> <unk> from trying to <unk> <unk>
but that <unk> would n't <unk> for <unk> he <unk> money and people <unk>
so mr. <unk> <unk> three new <unk> <unk> and <unk> them to a new <unk> in <unk> called the <unk> <unk> force
but that <unk> was n't <unk> he <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a force even though it cost $ N billion or $ N billion a year
after mr. <unk> was <unk> in N the <unk> 's <unk> <unk> the credit and then went after president <unk> and <unk> <unk>
i <unk> what he did to them <unk>
it made my <unk> <unk> with <unk>
why he used to <unk> in <unk> for <unk> <unk> he <unk> <unk> from <unk> some <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> him by the <unk> and <unk> him <unk> he <unk> up an additional $ N billion or so
<unk> added four more <unk> to the <unk> two <unk> and two reserve two <unk> groups to the <unk> a division <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> to the air force
he bought $ N billion in <unk> <unk> and $ N billion in <unk> and equipment to <unk> them and <unk> them at a new $ N billion base at <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
he <unk> all these new <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
one <unk> both <unk> 's <unk> and the <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> him to the <unk>
before they <unk> him go he added a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> in <unk> and <unk> it central <unk>
he <unk> those <unk> charge of all <unk> operations in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> it would be good <unk> for those <unk> <unk> <unk> they would get the <unk> <unk>
they had <unk> <unk> the <unk> around but it turned out that they had <unk> all about <unk> <unk>
but the <unk> still <unk> <unk> out at <unk> so <unk> bought a <unk> <unk> <unk> more and $ N billion of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in order that those seven new <unk> <unk> and three <unk> <unk> could <unk> from all those new <unk> and <unk> and go to war in the <unk> <unk>
then <unk> <unk> 's <unk> came to <unk> and said what the <unk> are you doing <unk> for a <unk> war in <unk> N <unk> away
we <unk> get our <unk> <unk>
<unk> for <unk> <unk> was <unk> and soon went away while the <unk> he <unk> coming back
so the u.s. found itself <unk> about $ N billion in <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> rights around the <unk> <unk>
we had great <unk> in <unk>
but then it turned out that president <unk> <unk> was not at all a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> out that the base he <unk> us in <unk> had <unk> up about a <unk> years ago and <unk> was N <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk>
but who 's <unk>
still <unk> was the best we could get so we <unk> in <unk> with president <unk>
all these reports about him <unk> <unk> are probably <unk> <unk>
but would n't you know now that we are spending <unk> of dollars and have <unk> those new <unk> and new air <unk> and have <unk> all these <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> in <unk> the <unk> <unk> to have lost interest in the <unk> subject
meanwhile congress is <unk> huge <unk> out of the <unk> of the defense budget
<unk> some <unk> <unk> said do we still need to keep all N <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> and all those <unk> <unk> <unk> without <unk> and all those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
could n't we <unk> $ N billion or $ N billion a year by <unk> that <unk> to the reserves
and why not <unk> the costs of a <unk> <unk> by <unk> central <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> operations back where it <unk> <unk> with the <unk> force <unk> in the <unk>
and where were all our <unk> paid <unk> <unk> <unk> last year when our <unk> were being <unk>
<unk> like that really <unk> up <unk> 's <unk>
he <unk> late one <unk> in the <unk> of the new defense secretary <unk> <unk>
<unk> came <unk> in like <unk> 's <unk> <unk> those <unk> of <unk> and air <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
he would n't <unk> until mr. <unk> <unk> to do <unk> the <unk> systems analysts told him
so next day mr. <unk> went out and did just that he <unk> the <unk> <unk> and cut back one <unk> and N <unk>
then he <unk> production of the <unk> 's most important <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
on the other <unk> mr. <unk> <unk> all those new <unk> <unk>
<unk> 's <unk> is <unk> for now but he 'll be back
what with <unk> coming and <unk> defense <unk> <unk> more and more <unk> <unk> are <unk> under their <unk>
they know that they can hold off the <unk> only a little while longer by <unk> <unk> and <unk>
then the <unk> thing will start to <unk> just as it did in the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> will be <unk> through the place <unk> people 's <unk> white

<unk> <unk> <unk> is reported to have said once that if you <unk> the world on its <unk> <unk> <unk> would end up in california
we 've always thought that mr. <unk> <unk> california 's <unk> but <unk> the state 's <unk> <unk> are <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that made it such a significant place
what <unk> is one to make of the <unk> <unk> <unk> just proposed by several major <unk> groups and <unk> by the state 's attorney general
if <unk> by the <unk> the recently announced <unk> would <unk> out major <unk> reduce <unk> <unk> <unk> by N N <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> thought to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a new state <unk> officer <unk> with a $ N million budget to <unk> any firm or agency he <unk> is being too <unk>
the <unk> is based largely on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> defense <unk> the national <unk> campaign and the <unk> for a better <unk>
<unk> the <unk> defense fund is having <unk> to do with this one
not only <unk> but all <unk> would pay if this thing <unk>

<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> would have to <unk> or give up the california market
in other <unk> california is <unk> to take control of the nation 's <unk> policy
as <unk> the <unk> <unk> 's proposal is <unk> from <unk> <unk>
consider the <unk> <unk>
the proposed <unk> would <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> of N N
even if one <unk> into the <unk> <unk> <unk> it is <unk> that <unk> in a <unk> state could have any impact on what is <unk> as a <unk> problem
but if <unk> <unk> and <unk> have <unk> to do with the new <unk> <unk> what is going on
the first place to look under these <unk> is at the <unk> in which the <unk> themselves will <unk>
the key here is the <unk> of state attorney general john <unk> de <unk>
he 's <unk> for <unk>
mr. <unk> de <unk> is the one who <unk> the plans from the <unk> <unk> <unk> groups and <unk> them into a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> on the <unk> for <unk> on nov. N N
that 's also the day of the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> seems to have been <unk> to include all the <unk> issues that set off the <unk> <unk> <unk> who <unk> money
and it <unk> mr. <unk> de <unk> to get around campaign spending <unk>
he can <unk> the legal <unk> for his campaign all the spending for the <unk> de <unk> <unk> on which there are no <unk> is <unk>
this <unk> is being <unk> the big <unk> but <unk> it should be called the big <unk>
the <unk> <unk> sen. <unk> <unk> is <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> too <unk> his own <unk> <unk>
while it is possible that the big <unk> <unk> will be <unk> <unk> it is of course <unk> that in <unk> california it could <unk> through
this is the state that recently <unk> the <unk> N <unk> <unk>
if this new proposal ever does become law the <unk> <unk> will <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> a free <unk> state <unk> officer to <unk> companies or government <unk> that do things he does n't like
that means the <unk> and such groups no longer would have to <unk> as much money on <unk> <unk> would <unk> the cost
mr. <unk> de <unk> and his <unk> may be <unk> that the <unk> is such a <unk> and <unk> issue among certain <unk> of california 's <unk> now that almost any <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> can <unk> under its <unk>
of course the state 's <unk> are not yet a nation <unk> themselves
<unk> bush for example may <unk> that he does n't want to be the president who lost control of <unk> <unk> to an attorney general from california
and some other <unk> of california 's political and <unk> <unk> may yet start to point out that the <unk> would <unk> significant costs on the state 's less <unk> <unk> in the form of higher food prices and lost <unk>
this <unk> <unk> will help california <unk> itself for the future either as a state still <unk> to economic and <unk> <unk> or as one being led to <unk> its <unk> <unk> want to take it
