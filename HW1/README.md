# Homework 1
In this directory is our code for Homework 1. Note that the datafiles became too unwieldy for Github once we started adding new features, and so we decided to not push those, and instead just include a link to Google Drive where you can find them. Here is the link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxeDHwW3Wsxfc0ZqTk5zcjdaQ00
